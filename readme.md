# Introduction

This collection gathers impulses and imperatives that steer a life toward depth and meaning. It maps resolve: living deliberately, honoring poetry and passion alongside necessary labor, naming the quiet desperation that can gnaw at ordinary days, and asserting agency rather than servitude. The pieces collected here hold urgency without rhetoric and point toward a fuller way of being.

# Sayings
1. > I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately; to front only the essential facts of life.  
    > I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life — to put to rout all that was not life, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.  

2. > We don't read and write poetry because it's cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race, and the human race is filled with passion.  
    > Medicine, law, business, engineering — these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love — these are what we stay alive for.  

3. > "Most men lead lives of quiet desperation."  
    — Henry David Thoreau

4. > To struggle against great odds, to meet enemies undaunted;  
    > to be a sailor of the world, bound for all ports.  
    > Oh, I live to be the ruler of life, not a slave.
